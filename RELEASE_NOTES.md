# Eclipse m2e - Release notes

### Next release

#### Automatically launch and attach Remote-Application-Debugger when Maven plug-in starts a forked JVM that waits for a debugger

If a Maven plug-in like `Maven-Surefire`, `Tycho-Surefire` or `Tycho-Eclipserun` launches a separate ("forked") JVM process in debug mode, so that it waits for a debugger being attached and prints a line like `Listening for transport dt_socket at address: <port-number>`,
M2E now detects such lines and automatically launches a `Remote-Application-Debugger` in the context of the workspace project being build at that time and using the printed port. As usual the debugger stops at encountered break-points so one can step through the code or analyze the state of variables.

For example to debug a test executed by the Maven-surefire plug-in within a Maven build, one only has to specify the property `maven.surefire.debug=true` in the Maven launch-configuration and the debugger will just stop at the break-points in the executed tests:

Further information, how to activate the debug mode of forked JVMs for the plug-ins mentioned above, can be found at the following links:

- [Tycho-Surefire](https://www.eclipse.org/tycho/sitedocs/tycho-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html#debugPort)
- [Tycho-Eclipserun](https://www.eclipse.org/tycho/sitedocs/tycho-extras/tycho-eclipserun-plugin/eclipse-run-mojo.html#jvmArgs)


#### Improved links to JUnit test-reports and project pom.xml in the Console of a Maven build

Clicking on the link placed at the name of a running test-class now opens the `JUnit` view that displays the test-reports of the executed tests:

For each project build a link is now added to the project's headline, which opens the project's `pom.xml` file when clicked:

In case of a build failure another link, that opens the `pom.xml` of the failed project, is added to the line that that describes the failure at the very end of the Maven build print-out:

#### the m2e-pde editor now supports generation of a feature from a location:

In the wizard it is now possible to request generation of a feature

If the option is checked the wizard contains a new page to enter basic infos

If one likes he can add additional plugins as well that should be mentioned in the feature (but this step is optional)

Afterwards this will end up in the target source and one can add/edit/adjust additional data, effectivly everything the feature.xml supports is allowed here:

## 1.19.0

* üìÖ Release Date: November 22nd 2021
* All changes: https://github.com/eclipse-m2e/m2e-core/compare/1.18.2...1.19.0

#### Generic Editor with LemMinX-Maven used as default source editor

The legacy WTP-based pom editor is not included by default anymore. The LemMinX-Maven based editor is now referenced by default from the main feature, but as optional, so it can still be uninstalled, and the legacy editor can be manually installed instead.

The new editor brings more powerful pom.xml understanding and edition features; and evolves much faster than the WTP-based one.

## 1.18.2

* üìÖ Release Date: October 15th 2021
* All changes: https://github.com/eclipse-m2e/m2e-core/compare/1.18.1...1.18.2

#### the m2e-pde editor now supports adding more than one dependency per target location:

```
<target name="multipleElements">
<locations>
	<location includeDependencyScope="compile" includeSource="true" missingManifest="generate" type="Maven">
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.eclipse.jetty</groupId>
			<artifactId>jetty-server</artifactId>

</locations>
</target>
```

Old target formats are automatically converted.

#### the m2e-pde editor now supports adding additional maven repoistories for a target location:

```

#### Multiple fixes and improvement in LemMinX based editor

With upgrade to newer LemMinX-Maven, the edition of pom.xml with the Generic Editor receives several comfortable fixes and improvements.

#### One way synchronization for jpms directives from maven compiler arguments to .classpath file

Extract jpms arguments (--add-exports,--add-opens,--add-reads,--patch-module) from the maven-compiler-plugin compiler arguments if any.
Dispatch the arguments in the right container (if the target module is part of JRE then in JreContainer else in M2eContainer) and
transform them into eclipse classpath attributes (add-exports, add-opens, add-reads, patch-module)

#### Improved m2e development workflow

Many improvements happened in m2e to facilitate the setup and maintenance of the development environment. See details in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
