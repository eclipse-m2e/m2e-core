## üí¨ Get in touch with the community

Eclipse m2e use mainly 2 channels for strategical and technical discussions

* üêû View and report issues through uses GitHub Issues at https://github.com/eclipse-m2e/m2e-core/issues. _üìú Migration to GitHub tracker took place in March 2021, for older tickets, see https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?product=m2e üìú_
* üìß Join the m2e-dev@eclipse.org mailing-list to get in touch with other contributors aboantiqueut project organizationa and planning, and browse archive at üìú [https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/m2e-dev](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/m2e-dev)


## üÜï Trying latest builds

Latest builds, for testing, can usually be found at https://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/snapshots/`${targetRelease}`/latest/ where `${targetRelease}` is the name of the **next** release.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developer resources

### Source repositories

Clone this repository <a href="https://mickaelistria.github.io/redirctToEclipseIDECloneCommand/redirect.html"><img src="https://mickaelistria.github.io/redirctToEclipseIDECloneCommand/cloneToEclipseBadge.png" alt="Clone to Eclipse IDE"/></a> for m2e-core.

Some tests are in a separate repository, that you should clone as well: see https://github.com/tesla/m2e-core-tests/

### ‚å®Ô∏è Setting up the Development Environment

* Use latest release of the Eclipse SDK or Eclipse IDE with the Plugin Development Environment installed.
* Make sure m2e is installed in this IDE, including the "m2e PDE" feature,
* _File > Open Projects from Filesystem..._ , select the path to m2e-core Git repo and the relevant children projects you want to import; approve m2e connectors installation if prompted
* Depending on the task you're planning to work on, multiple workflows are available to configure the [target-platform](https://help.eclipse.org/2021-03/topic/org.eclipse.pde.doc.user/concepts/target.htm?cp=4_1_5)
    * In many cases, this simplest workflow will be sufficient: Install latest m2e snapshot in your target-platform (can be your current IDE), or
    * If you don't want to mix versions of m2e, open  __target-platform/dev-worksace.target__  and  _Set as Target-Platform_  from the editor, or
    * In case you're working on the content of the `m2e-maven-runtime` folder, then run `mvn install -f m2e-maven-runtime/` after your changes to deploy them locally and then tweak the  _target-platform/dev-worksace.target_  to reference the versions of those artifacts you build locally and reload this target platform
* Open the project modules you want to work on (right-click > Open project) and their dependencies; approve m2e connectors installation if prompted
* Happy coding!


If you're going to hack the Maven runtime components in _m2e-maven-runtime_ folder (typically to change version of Maven runtime, indexer, archetypes... that are shipped by default with m2e), you may want to run `mvn install -f m2e-maven-runtime` as a preliminary step and to hack your target-platform to include the output of the build.

### üèóÔ∏è Build

First `mvn install -f m2e-maven-runtime` folder, then `mvn clean verify` from the root with typical usage of Maven+Tycho. The (long-running) integration tests are skipped by default, add `-Pits,uts` to your command in order to run them.

### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Version bump

m2e tries to use OSGi Semantic Version (to properly expose its API contracts and breakage) and Reproducible Version Qualifiers (to minimize the avoid producing multiple equivalent artifacts for identical source). This requires the developer to manually bump version from time to time. Somes rules are that:

* Versions are bumped on a __per module grain__ (bump version of individual bundles/features one by one when necessary), __DON'T bump version of parent pom, nor of other modules you don't change__
* __Versions are bumped maximum once per release__ (don't bump versions that were already bumped since last release)
* __Don't bump versions of what you don't change__
* __Bump version of the bundles you're modifying only if it's their 1st change since last release__
* Version bump may need to be cascaded to features that *include* the artifact you just changed, and then to features that *include* such features and so on (unless the version of those features were already bumped since last release).

The delta for version bumps are:

* `+0.0.1` (next micro) for a bugfix, or an internal change that doesn't surface to APIs
* `+0.1.0` (next minor) for an API addition
* `+1.0.0` (next major) for an API breakage (needs to be discussed on the mailing-list first)
* If some "smaller" bump already took place, you can replace it with your "bigger one". Eg, if last release has org.eclipse.m2e.editor 1.16.1; and someone already bumped version to 1.16.2 (for an internal change) and you're adding a new API, then you need to change version to 1.17.0
