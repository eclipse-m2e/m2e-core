/**
 * Maven execution context. Encapsulates maven execution request, maven session and related maven session state objects.
 * Instances can be either in configuration or execution states. In configuration state, {@link #getExecutionRequest()}
 * can be used to customize maven execution configuration parameters. Context enters execution state during {@link
 * #execute(..., IProgressMonitor)} invocation. During transition from configuration state to execution state, maven
 * session is created and the the context is associated with the current thread. Maven session instance and related
 * objects can be accessed through their corresponding context getXXX methods.
 * <p>
 * Maven execution contexts can be nested, i.e. new context can be created and entered from a thread that already has
 * associated maven execution context. By default nested contexts inherit all configuration from immediate outer
 * context, but can be customised via {@link #getExecutionRequest()}. Outer context is suspended during execution of
 * nested context's {@link #execute(ICallable, IProgressMonitor)} method.
 * <p>
 * Typical usage
 *
 * <pre>
 * IMavenExecutionContext context = maven.createExecutionContext();
 *
 * MavenProject project = context.execute(new ICallable&lt;MavenProject&gt;() {
 *   public MavenProject call(IMavenExecutionContext context, IProgressMonitor monitor) {
 *     return maven.readMavenProject(pom, monitor);
 *   }
 * }, monitor);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Maven execution context instances are not thread safe and cannot be used on other threads.
